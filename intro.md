##Introduction##
###My research question:
The people who want to make divorce laws more easier are also prone to justify the extramarital sex as 'no wrong at all', is that true?

###Why do you care?Why should others care?
General Social Survey (GSS) is a sociological survey about characteristics and attitudes. When I went through that survey, I found there are questions about the attitudes towards the divorce laws and the opinion about extramarital sex. At the same time, I found myself had a prejudice that the advocates of divorce laws are morally open to the extramarital sex. So I am very interested in this question and want to know whether it is true or not. 

The relationship between the attitudes to the divorce laws and the opinion about extramarital sex would be a hot topic for others, especially in the speed dating times. If the data analysis has convincing proof that the people who want to make divorce laws more easier are also prone to justify the extramarital sex, we can guess a person who support divorce laws with higher probability to justify extramarital sex.
